# MCJavaServerTermux
## What's this?
 This is a simple script for Installing a Minecraft Server in Termux. 
## What's so special?
 This script will make a Directory for Server in /sdcard (Your Internal Storage), so
 managing server files became easier. and more feature will come too..
## Code Status
 This script is still barebones. Fixup later. and Spigot,Paper option is not working too, nothing serious. just didnt have time to add filelist
